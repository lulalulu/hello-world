# hello-world
can't wait to see what's in store for me
yes i can. Im not sure if completed step 2. Im using tomorrowne to complete this task, but i will take a look at it tomorrow to be sure.
im learning this bithub and i dont want to move on until i know i have it.  i added a branch but still named it wrong i named it feature insted of readme edit. but i have the jist.  but wondering is there a way to change the name on that branch?
github@metionsystem what did i do wrong? there was no delete button at the end of the merge so i pressed the revert... what does that do?
